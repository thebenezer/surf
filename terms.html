                <ul>
                    <li>The following organizations may link to our Web site without prior written approval:
                        <ul>

                        <li>Search engines;</li>
                        <li>News organizations;</li>
                        <li>Online directory distributors when they list us in the directory may link to our Web site in the same
                            manner as they hyperlink to the Web sites of other listed businesses; and</li>
                        <li>Systemwide Accredited Businesses except soliciting non-profit organizations, charity shopping malls,
                            and charity fundraising groups which may not hyperlink to our Web site.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li>We may consider and approve in our sole discretion other link requests from the following types of organizations:
                        <ul>
                            <li>dot.com community sites;</li>
                            <li>associations or other groups representing charities, including charity giving sites,</li>

                representing inherently suspect types of business, such as work-at-home opportunities, shall not be allowed
                to link); (b)the organization does not have an unsatisfactory record with us; (c) the benefit to us from
                the visibility associated with the hyperlink outweighs the absence of Surf; and (d) where the
                link is in the context of general resource information or is otherwise consistent with editorial content
                in a newsletter or similar product furthering the mission of the organization.</p>

                <p>These organizations may link to our home page, to publications or to other Web site information so long as
                the link: (a) is not in any way misleading; (b) does not falsely imply sponsorship, endorsement or approval
                of the linking party and it products or services; and (c) fits within the context of the linking party's
                site.</p>

                <p>If you are among the organizations listed in above and are interested in linking to our website,
                you must notify us by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:info@surf.com" title="send an email to info@surf.com">info@surf.com</a>.
